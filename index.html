        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologistðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Julianna Hernandez and I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying psychology and graduating in 2025. I played division 1 soccer for four years at the university, and have experience being part of a leadership team for my highschool soccer team. After earning my degree I plan on continuing my education in education studies. I want to earn a teaching credential for the primary grade level and work my way up to having my own classroom. I currently work as a soccer coach for children under 10 years old. Here I manage over 20 kids at a time while their parents are at work. I like to integrate my knowledge in psychology when working with children this age because I do have experience in sports psychology as well. Along with coaching, I have an online part time job where I help children who are struggling with confidence perform better in their sports. I meet with one or two kids once a week to talk about their goals for training and games. Here I also use my experience with the recruiting process for college sports to help them find their way onto their dream college team. I plan out their week with drills they can do to improve their technique, tips on how to improve their confidence, and examples on what to include in emails being sent to college coaches.<br><br>

        My experience playing club soccer since childhood and in college has allowed me to mentor younger athletes in reaching both academic and athletic goals. My fascination with psychology and experience as a college athlete has allowed me to have a better understanding of the importance of mental health in athletes. This background has helped me push my team when coaching in a positive manner where the children enjoy what theyâ€™re doing but also improving technically. When it came to my career I knew I wanted to work with children but I wanted to integrate my knowledge in psychology. As a teacher for primary students I will be able to help children learn in a positive environment because I understand the importance of development in a safe environment for a child. I want to create a sense of comfort for children because I know how much fear and judgment as a child will have a lasting impact on their mental health as an adult.<br><br>

        Once I graduate from UCR I plan on working as a teaching assistant while I take classes for my teaching credential. Here I will have experience working with grades I want to work with later on. During the summers I also babysit part time for children of all ages which has helped me understand how to work and deal with children of all ages. My experience as an athlete, psychology major, athlete mentor, coach, and babysitter has paved the way for me and my career choices. This experience has allowed me to help and teach children of all ages and has revealed to me the passion I have for sports and psychology.
